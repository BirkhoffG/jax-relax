`ReLax` (**Re**course Explanation **L**ibrary in J**ax**) is a library
built on top of `jax` to generate counterfactual and recourse
explanations. By leveraging *vectorization* though `vmap`/`pmap` and
*just-in-time* compilation in `jax`, `ReLax` offers massive speed
improvements in generating individual (or local) explanations.

Some of the key features:

- **Fast** recourse generation via `jax.jit`, `jax.vmap`/`jax.pmap`.

- **Accelerated** over *CPU*, *GPU*, and *TPU*.

- **Extensive** recourse methods implemented for benchmarking.

- **Customizable** API to enable building entire modeling and
  interpreting pipeline.

## Installation

`ReLax` is built on top of
[Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The latest `ReLax` release can directly be installed from PyPI:

``` bash
pip install jax-relax
```

or install directly from the repository:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/BirkhoffG/ReLax.git 
```

To futher unleash the power of accelerators (i.e., GPU/TPU), we suggest
to first install this library via `pip install jax-relax`. Then, follow
steps in the [official install
guidelines](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) to install the
right version for GPU or TPU.

## An Example of using `ReLax`

See [Getting Started with ReLax](tutorials/getting_started.ipynb).
